## About project:
In this project, we are going to create a model that predicts the weather
and classifies it by using the soft computing technique “Back PropagationAlgorithm”. Weather prediction could be vital as a result of they’re used to secure life and property. Weather prediction is that the use of science and innovation to anticipate the state of the temperature for a future time at a given space. Temperature forecasts are made by collecting quantitative data regarding the present state of the atmosphere. It’s themethod of recording the parameters of weather like wind direction, wind speed, humidity, rainfall, the temperature then on. Here one parameter states temperature that differs by a couple of units and therefore the
variation on alternative parameters saying humidness, temperature, andrain which are going to be foreseen with relevancy temperature. The outcomes make sure that our model has the potential for effective application for weather prediction.
